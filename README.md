## Troubleshooting

- **Didn’t get the verification email?**  
  Check **Spam/Junk** and search for “Bimileap”.

- **Scraping stuck or empty?**  
  Ensure the page stays open; try different hashtags or a broader year range.

- **Edits not saving?**  
  Press **Enter** after typing to commit each field.

- **Images missing in README preview?**  
  Confirm this repository contains `./images/media/` with the extracted files and that paths match exactly (case-sensitive).
